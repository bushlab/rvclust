10 (of 10) markers to be included from [ data/test.map ]
14 individuals read from [ data/test.ped ] 
14 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
7 cases, 7 controls and 0 missing
14 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10 SNPs
14 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 10 SNPs
After filtering, 7 cases, 7 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 14 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
